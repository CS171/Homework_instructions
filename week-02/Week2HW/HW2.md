# Week 2 Homework

In the first part of this homework, you will create a simple webpage with HTML and CSS.

In the second part, you will do a design critique on an infographic visualization.

This homework assumes that you have read Chapter 3 (up to page 36) in *D3 - Interactive Data Visualization for the Web* (Second Edition!) by Scott Murray.

&nbsp;


## 1. Web Development Basics: HTML & CSS (5 points)


### Data

The following table shows countries with an alarming hunger situation based on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores from 1990, 2000, and 2014. The Index ranks countries on a 100-point scale, with 0 being the best score (no hunger) and 100 being the worst.

Country | 1990 | 2000 | 2014
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------
Central African Republic | 51.9	 | 51.4 | 46.9
Chad | 65 | 52 | 46.4
Haiti | 52.1 | 42.8	 | 37.3
Madagascar | 44.8 | 44.1 | 36.3
Sierra Leone | 58.8	 | 53.5 | 38.9
East Timor | — | — | 40.7
Zambia | 47 | 50.9 | 41.1


*The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger globally and by country and region. Calculated each year by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the GHI highlights successes and failures in hunger reduction and provides insights into the drivers of hunger.* (IFPRI, 2015)


### Design and Implementation

Please follow these instructions.

a. **Create a new HTML file `index.html` and a new external CSS file.**

You should give some thought to the organization of the files and folders of your web/visualization projects. Instead of dumping everything in one folder, we suggest the following structure for the beginning:
	
```
hw/	
	index.html
	css/ 		...folder with all CSS files
	js/ 		...folder with all JavaScript files
```

b. **Include your external stylesheet in your HTML file**

c. **Start populating your `body` by laying out a grid for your page**

Read through the homework and come up with a reasonable grid for your page. Here's a [.png image](https://github.com/CS171/Homework_instructions/blob/master/Week2HW/assets/HW2%20Solution.png) of our implementation that might help you to decide on a suitable grid structure. You might have noticed that we kept this hw rather short and simple so that you can focus on key-concepts such as the bootstrap grid system. From now on, we always expect you to create and use a reasonable, accurate, and flawlessly implemented grid system for all your coding projects.

d. **Add a headline to the HTML `body`**

e. **Embed the given table (Global Hunger Index) in HTML** 

Please be aware of the different html tags for rows with column names and rows with actual data (i.e., table header, table row). The bootstrap documentation might come in handy: [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/tables/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/tables/)

f. **Center your elements**

In this homework, we want you to center both the heading and the table. Centering can be achieved through tweaking the parent-child relation between elements. If you have problems centering an element, you should always examine the dimensions and properties of the element you want to center as well as the ones of its parent. Making use of the bootstrap classes ```justify-content-center``` and ```self-align-center``` is one out of various ways to center an element. Here is an example that should be of help. Check it out - but make sure you have bootstrap embedded when you do! 
```
<div class="container">
    <div class="row justify-content-center" style="background: green; height: 33.3vh; margin-top: 33.3vh">
        <div class="align-self-center" style="padding: 2vh; background: red">
            <button class="btn btn-dark">I am a button sitting in a red centered DIV</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```


g. **Add several custom styles to your external CSS file**

You can choose your design parameters freely (i.e., decisions about fonts, colors or scales are up to you) but make sure to include at least:
	
  - Custom font (e.g. Arial)
  - Custom style for the headline
  - Highlight column names in the table
  - Alternating row colors for the table

*Keeping your CSS rules separate means that you can use styles multiple times and your HTML documents remain clean and understandable.*

h. **Download and include the given JavaScript file `sortable.js` at the bottom of the `body` element.**

[https://github.com/CS171/Homework_instructions/blob/master/Week2HW/assets/sortable.js](https://github.com/CS171/Homework_instructions/blob/master/Week2HW/assets/sortable.js)

Make sure to save the contents of this file as .js file! This script provides some additional functionality and makes your table sortable. Over the course of the semester, you will learn more about integrating interactive components with JavaScript but for this homework, it is fine if you include our given library. Example integration:

```
<script src="js/sortable.js"></script>
```

i. **Add the class name `sortable` to the `table` Element**

If you have implemented everything correctly you should be able to sort the columns by clicking on the column names.

j. **Add a two-column layout below the table**

You should use the empty containers in the following exercise (*Infographic Design Critique*). Add the infographic to the left column and the answers to the questions in part *c* to the right column.

*Please use Bootstrap's [grid-system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/), leveraging what you learned in this week's Lab. It is very flexible and will definitely be helpful for future projects. 

*As a general rule, only use html `<table>` tags in an html layout to display data that can be well-represented in rows and columns (i.e., tabular data). Do not use it as a general layouting device!*

#### Bonus (1 point)

In case you've finished all the tasks above as well as the Infographic Design Critique you can earn a bonus point by also implementing a slideshow/carousel component. We'd recommend that you examine the bootstrap documentation for some helpful sample code. As for the content of the carousel, we'd like you to include your examples for good or bad visualizations in the slideshow that you identified in last week's HW (Week 1). Make sure to use a proper headline for the slideshow.

&nbsp;

## 2. Infographic Design Critique  (5 points)

a. **First read the Design Critique Overview in Canvas.**

b. **Then look at this visualization of the top 10 salaries at Google:**  [![Creative Commons License](cs171-hw2-infographic.png)](https://www.jobvine.co.za/what-does-it-take-to-get-a-job-at-google/)

c. **Extend your previously created** `index.html` **file and add the following:**

- A screenshot of the salary visualization in the left column. 
- An analysis of the visualization with answers to the following questions in the right column: 
  - Who is the audience? 
  - What questions does it answer?
  - What is the data? be specific, including data types (N,O,Q). 
  - For each data type, how is it visually encoded?
  - Do you like this visualization? Why or why not?


***Add this information to your two-column layout.*** *In the left column the screenshot and in the right column the answers to the questions above*


## 3. Submit Homework on Canvas

**Name your folder appropriately. Go to Canvas and click on the `Submission - Week 2 HW & Lab` link in the week's modules. Next, upload a zipped folder containing both your homework files and your lab submission.**

To upload an entire directory structure please compress your entire local directory into a zip file. Use the following recommended folder structure:

```
/submission_week2_FirstnameLastname	
    lab/             
        index.html
        css/ 		...folder with all CSS files
        js/ 		...folder with all JavaScript files\
    hw/
        index.html
        css/ 		...folder with all CSS files
        js/ 		...folder with all JavaScript files\
    
       
```
Note that you should add your name to the filename using CamelCase style, e.g., ```submission_week2_JohnDoe.zip``` if your name is John Doe. 

**Congratulations on finishing Homework 2! See you in class!**


<!--
*For your final submission, you will have to:*

- Click the 'submit' button
Double-check your 'latest submission', check that all the visualizations are working as you expect. You can run them directly in Vocareum and look at them in a new window.
- Upload a teaser image of your homework (under 'Action'/'upload gallery thumbnail'. This teaser will show up in the classes gallery and should motivate other students to look at your solution in more detail.

*After the homework deadline you will be able to:*

- Look at the gallery with all other student submissions
- Give peer feedback or comments to other students (Please use proper manners and constructive criticism!)
- Give stars to other students' work (this will not influence grading!)
