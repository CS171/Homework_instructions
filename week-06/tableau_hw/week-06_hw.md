# Homework 6


Your task is to design an interactive, exploratory Tableau dashboard, focusing on the Pharmaceutical Data, that helps users discover insights or trends.


## 1) Tableau Dashboard of the Pharmaceutical Data

You will first learn about Tableau dashboards and then design your own dashboard. You will have to fine-tune some of the visualizations you have created during class over the last weeks and then combine them into an interactive dashboard. We expect you to link some of the visualizations (i.e., you can select one element in one visualization and it will highlight in the other view). You also have to incorporate an advanced visualization (i.e., a visualization that requires a bit more work and is not part of Tableau's "Show Me" feature).


### Task 1.1: Learn how to create a Tableau Dashboard

- Begin by watching this instructive [tutorial](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/how-to-videos) on how to assemble a Dashboard in Tableau.


### Task 1.2: Design your dashboard

- First, decide which visualizations you want to include in your dashboard. You should include at least 3 visualizations that you have worked on before in class.
- Design an *advanced visualization* that will also become a part of your dashboard. Advanced means that the visualization should not be part of the "show me" feature in Tableau. Feel free to get inspired by the visual vocabulary Tableau workbook that we have posted on Canvas.
- Sketch a preliminary layout of your envisioned dashboard on paper. Hint: You can use sticky notes for the individual visualizations, which allows you to move the individual visualizations around and arrange them onto the dashboard sketch as you like. Make sure to include legends, titles, axes, etc.

### Task 1.3: Implement your visualizations

- Create your advanced visualization.
- Fine-tune your other visualizations to include titles, labels, legends, etc. Make sure to use a consistent color scheme.

### Task 1.4: Implement your dashboard

- Then, create your dashboard and arrange all the individual views as per your dashboard design.
- Make sure to link at least two views, so that you can select an element in one visualization, which automatically adjusts the linked view(s)
- Include at least one filter in the user interface.
- Make sure your dashboard has a title, and that visualizations have appropriate titles and legends.


## 2) Submit Homework in Canvas
