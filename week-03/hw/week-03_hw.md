# Week 03 | Homework

In this assignment, you’ll use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a small dashboard for a local pizza delivery company. It should help the company to get meaningful insights into their collected data and to evaluate their performance. We provide a template that will serve as your point of departure code.

In the design part of this homework you have to critique a visualization (you can choose between two given examples) and you have to create a few sketches, similar to our previous lecture.

This homework assumes that you have read and programmed along with chapter 3 (up to page 53) in *D3 - Interactive Data Visualization for the Web* (Second Edition) by Scott Murray.

## 1. Complete this week's lab! 
Please complete the lab - ideally before you start with this homework. It is due with the rest of this homework, you can find the upload link on Canvas, in this weeks module.

&nbsp;

## 2. PizzaWorld - Insights & Statistics (6 points)

### Template

We are providing a small template (*Bootstrap* already included) for this homework. It is quite similar to the framework which we have used in this week's lab and should help you to get started. You can download the framework for this week's homework via canvas: 
 [here's the link](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/74834/files/10574103?module_item_id=752111)

When exploring the folder structure and its contents you will notice that we are providing all the files you need. Your only job is to 1) understand the code and 2) to extend the following files:

- ```index.html```
- ```css/style.css```
- ```js/main_presentation.js```


### Data

We have included two datasets from *PizzaWorld* in the framework. One table has 1198 rows with pizza deliveries and the other table has 200 rows with corresponding customer feedback.

The data (arrays with JSON objects) are already stored in these two global variables:

- ```deliveryData```
- ```feedbackData```

*The variables are accesible in the JS file ```main_presentation.js```*

*To get started, write the variables to the web console and inspect them.*

#### Delivery Data

- ```delivery_id```
- ```date```
- ```area``` (Boston | Cambridge | Somerville)
- ```price``` (in USD)
- ```count``` (number of delivered pizzas)
- ```driver```
- ```delivery_time``` (minutes)
- ```temperature```
- ```drinks_ordered``` (true | false)
- ```order_type``` (web | phone)


#### Feedback Data

- ```delivery_id``` (matches the deliveries)
- ```punctuality``` (medium | low | high)
- ```quality ``` (medium | low | high)
- ```wrong_pizza ``` (true | false)



### Implementation

1. **Download template**

	If you haven't done so already, please download the template [here](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/74834/files/folder/homeworks/week-03-hw-template)
	
2. **Display dataset summary**

	Open ```main_presentation.js```. You'll find an empty function ```createVisualization()``` that you'll populate in order to update the DOM dynamically.
	Start by extracting the following numbers from the provided data and append them with 
	meaningful labels to the HTML document:	
	* Number of pizza deliveries
	* Number of all delivered pizzas (*count*)
	* Average delivery time
	* Total sales in USD
	* Number of all feedback entries
	* Number of feedback entries per quality category: *low*, *medium*, *high*

	→ You should do all of that (extracting numbers and adding labels to HTML) directly in JavaScript. Update the DOM dynamically with JavaScript!
	
	*Feel free to use plain JavaScript methods (see this week's lab), or the library jQuery to update the content. The JS framework jQuery is already included because it is required for Bootstrap. You can learn more about jQuery on these websites: [jquery.com](https://jquery.com/) or [w3schools.com/jquery/](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/).*

	>Make sure you test your code after you have implemented this part! Once your code is working, consider your code structure and code design: 
	>
	> a) If your code is already longer than a couple of lines, extract it into a separate function and call that function within *createVisualization()*.
	>  
	> b) Think about calculating the above numbers at the same time (e.g., inside a single loop), if possible. That will make the code shorter and easier to read, as well as faster. 
	> 
	> c) Make sure you use consistent spacing, layout, self-explanatory variable names, and code comments! If you do this as you progress in your coding project, this will save you a lot of time later!


3. **Call the function:** ***renderBarChart(deliveryData)***

	So far, you should have done all your DOM manipulation inside of ```createVisualization()```. If you call *renderBarChart()* our script will automatically group (and count) the deliveries per day. Subsequently a bar chart will be added to the container: ```#chart-area```.

	Requirements:
	- You need a div-container with the id ```#chart-area``` in your HTML document 
	- As a **function parameter**, you have to include a JSON array with deliveries (each delivery is an object and must include at least the property: ```date```). Try to call *renderBarChart()* (inside ```createVisualization```) with the argument ```deliveryData```.

	→ You should now see a basic bar chart on your page. 

4. **Filter the data before drawing the bar chart**
	
	In the next task, you should filter the ```deliveryData``` array depending on the selected options, before calling *renderBarChart()*.

	a. Add two **select-boxes** to your HTML document. The user should be able to select:
	
	- ```area``` (*All*, *Boston*, *Cambridge* or *Somerville*)
	- ```order type``` (*All*, *Web* or *Phone*).
	
	Make sure to set the callback function of the select boxes to the function that updates and creates our visualization!
	
	b. If the user selects an option, filter the variable ```deliveryData``` accordingly and then call *renderBarChart()* again. Every time you call this function, it will analyze all changes in your array and update the chart with D3.
	
	>It is good practice to do a sanity check on the result you get after filtering or processing data. Take a look at the original data, do the numbers make sense? Are there missing values? This is especially important when dealing with real-world data that has not been cleaned and prepared for easy use in a homework ;-)

5. **Global data filtering**

	In the previous step you have implemented a function which reacts to the user input (change of a select-box value) and updates the chart immediately.
	
	Additionally, these filter options should also affect the displayed dataset summary that you implemented earlier.
	
	→ If the user filters the data by a specific ```area``` or ```order type``` you should **update the bar chart and the display of the summary data** from step (2).
	
	*Hint: The data are stored in two separate variables. Make sure your filtering algorithm influences customer feedback as well as order data.*
	
6. **Style your webpage using CSS.**
 
	We already provided a simple css file in our template. Adjust either the CSS or the html elements you dynamically generate to create a visually pleasing and easy to read webpage.
	Lastly, make sure to include a tooltip ```div``` in your DOM. Check out  ```barchart.js``` and  ```style.css``` to understand why ```#tooltip``` is already working.
	```
        <div id="tooltip" class="hidden">
            <p><strong>Deliveries</strong></p>
            <p><span id="value"></span></p>
        </div>

## 3. Design Creation & Explanation (4 points)

In last week's homework, you had a chance to familiarize yourself with the following infographic. This week, we want you to get creative!
 
[![Creative Commons License](cs171-hw2-infographic.png)](https://www.jobvine.co.za/what-does-it-take-to-get-a-job-at-google/)
- **Create a sketch of a redesign for the Google salary visualization.**
- Name and justify all your changes you made using C.R.A.P. and Gestalt principles that you've learned class.
- We expect you to write a text in the range of 200-400 words.
- Write the text with your computer.
- Take a picture of your sketch or scan it.
- Create a PDF (creation.pdf) that contains both the sketch and your explanation/justification.

## 5. Bonus Task (1 points)

Please make sure to finish all the previous tasks before you start with the bonus activity. Extra credit is only given if the rest of the homework has been completed and the full possible points have been received. This task is intended for those of you who already have more experience with HTML, CSS and JS.

You are currently showing overall statistics and a bar chart on your website. Whenever the user changes a selection, the corresponding dataset will be filtered and the views are getting updated. In this bonus task you should extend the dashboard with a sortable table view to show the individual customer feedbacks.

Column names:

- Delivery ID
- Area
- Time [min]
- Driver
- Number of pizzas
- Punctuality
- Quality
- Wrong Pizza

You should also connect the table with the select-boxes and your update mechanism. If the user selects *Boston* and *Phone*, the rows should be filtered accordingly.

You can use the same script as in HW1 to make your table sortable: 

[https://github.com/CS171/Homework_instructions/blob/master/Week2HW/assets/sortable.js](https://github.com/CS171/Homework_instructions/blob/master/Week2HW/assets/sortable.js) *(Hint: use the class name 'sortable')*


## 6. Teaser / Prospect

Next week, there will be a bonus task for the design portion of the homework. It is part of the 'Dear Data' - you'll learn everything yo need to know in the lecture this week, i.e. week 3. That said, if you feel like earning three extra points next week, you better start collecting some personal data over the week. 

## 7. Submit Homework in Canvas

a. Put your JS homework in the folder structure 'submission_FirstnameLastname/hw/implementation'.

b. Put your PDF file in the folder structure 'submission_FirstnameLastname/hw/design'

c. Zip your folder and upload it on Canvas for your homework submission.


Use the following recommended folder structure:

```
/submission_FirstnameLastname	
	hw/
	    implementation/
   	        index.html
	        css/ 		...folder with all CSS files
	        js/ 		...folder with all JavaScript files
	    design/
	        creation.pdf
	    ...
```
Note that you should add your name to the filename using CamelCase style, e.g., `submission_JohnDoe.zip` if your name is John Doe.

**Congratulations for finishing the homework for this week! See you in class!**

<!--

For your final submission you will have to:

- Click the 'submit' button
Double-check your 'latest submission', check that all the visualizations are working as you expect. You can run them directly in Vocareum and look at them in a new window
- Upload a teaser image of your homework (under 'Action'/'upload gallery thumbnail'. This teaser will show up in the classes gallery and should motivate other students to look at your solution in more detail.

After the homework deadline you will be able to:

- Look at the gallery with all other student submissions
- Give peer feedback or comments to other students (Please use proper manners and constructive criticism!)
- Give stars to other students' work (this will not influence grading!)
