# Homework 1 - Due Wednesday, Sept. 8, 2021 by noon EDT

In this homework, you will consider different visualizations and analyze their primary purpose, whether they succeed or not, and the critical aspects of what makes visualizations compelling, effective, and impactful.

If you have not done so already, please also complete HW0 on Canvas (Canvas/Modules/Course Preview) as well.

&nbsp;


## 1. *Good & Bad* Visualizations (3 points)


*The use of visualization to present information is pervasive in the media. A visual representation is a powerful and effective way to make complicated and confusing information more relevant and easy to understand.*

Here are some general questions to consider as you go through the next section: What is your opinion about good and bad visualizations? What are good visualization characteristics? What makes a visualization bad, hard to understand, or misleading (communicating the wrong information)?


a. **Search online for *one good and one bad* visualization.**

Choose two examples from different authors and online sources. You can use [http://viz.wtf/](http://viz.wtf/) for inspiration, but please try to find examples from other sources.

   * Include a screenshot of the visualization along with a reference (URL) to the source.
   * Where did you find it? Title? Add any relevant information about it.
   * On a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best), how good or bad is this visualization?

b. **Give a brief (one paragraph) critique for each visualization - why is it good or bad? Include the following:**

   * Describe the positive and negative aspects. Be as specific as possible.
   * Authors of visualizations try to answer specific questions about a dataset. What questions do you think the authors tried to answer? Did they succeed?
   * What improvements to the visualization would you suggest?

## 2. *Exploratory vs. Explanatory* Visualizations (4 points)

**Look at these online examples of exploratory and explanatory visualizations.**

* [You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children's College Chances](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all)  (if you hit hit the NYT paywall, Google "You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Childrenâ€™s College Chances" and click on the first result)
* [An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton ](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/hamilton/)
* [Bussed out - How America moves its homeless](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study)

For each of these visualizations, tell us:

* Is it exploratory or explanatory, and why do you think so?
* What question(s) about the data did the authors try to answer?
* What new insights did you learn from the visualization?
* Who is the likely audience of the visualization?
* Does it have a point of view or a message, and can you describe it?


## 3. *Effective* Visualizations (3 points)

**Watch the [Hans Rosling TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen#t-280857) (watch until 4:40) and answer the following questions:**

* What does Hans Rosling do and say to communicate his data effectively?
* Give a comprehensive list with your explanation for each observation.
* What strikes you about his visualization?
* Provide some concrete examples of what you saw and how it worked for you.
* Overall, did his talk have an impact on you? Did you change your mind or did you learn anything new?

## 4. *Design Sprint*
Please finish up week 1 of the design sprint you started during class. You can find the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FBZ3nZZrKcQq80vjo2Ai2cKcn1BZRGRiD-4nK2fCaM/edit). Your design sprint submission is the Google Doc process book of your team. Your design sprint mentor will look at your process book every week and give you feedback, so please make sure that it always is up to date.

## Lab Reading & Quiz Reminder

Don't forget to complete the lab pre-reading and pre-quiz before lab on Wednesday, Sept. 8. They are posted on Canvas in the *Week 2* module.


## 4. Submit Homework on Canvas

You can use a Google doc to answer the HW questions. Include the screenshots of your visualizations (Q1) in the document. You can then create a PDF file from your Google doc by either using "File -> Download -> pdf "or "File -> Print "and selecting "Save as PDF "in the destination drop down.

**Name your PDF file appropriately (e.g., hw1) and include your name.** Add your name to the filename using CamelCase style, e.g., ```hw1_JohnDoe.pdf``` if your name is John Doe.

**Go to Canvas and click on the HW 1 - Submission link in the *Week 1* module and upload your PDF**

**Congratulations on finishing Homework 1! Remember that weekly HW will always be due on Wednesdays.**
