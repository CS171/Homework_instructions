# Homework 1 - Due Monday, Sept. 5, 2022 by noon EDT

In this homework, you will consider different visualizations and analyze their primary purpose, whether they succeed or not, and the critical aspects of what makes visualizations compelling, effective, and impactful.

If you have not done so already, please also complete HW0 on Canvas (Canvas/Modules/Course Preview) as well.

&nbsp;


## 1. *Good & Bad* Visualizations (4 points)


*The use of visualization to present information is pervasive in the media. A visual representation is a powerful and effective way to make complicated and confusing information more relevant and easy to understand.*

Here are some general questions to consider as you go through the next section: What is your opinion about good and bad visualizations? What are good visualization characteristics? What makes a visualization bad, hard to understand, or misleading (communicating the wrong information)?


a. **Search online for *one good and one bad* visualization.**

Choose two examples from different authors and online sources. You can use [http://viz.wtf/](http://viz.wtf/) for inspiration, but please try to find examples from other sources.

   * Include a screenshot of the visualization along with a reference (URL) to the source.
   * Where did you find it? Title? Add any relevant information about it.
   * On a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best), how good or bad is this visualization?

b. **Give a brief (one paragraph) critique for each visualization - why is it good or bad? Include the following:**

   * Describe the positive and negative aspects. Be as specific as possible.
   * Authors of visualizations try to answer specific questions about a dataset. What questions do you think the authors tried to answer? Did they succeed?
   * What improvements to the visualization would you suggest?

## 2. *Exploratory vs. Explanatory* Visualizations (4 points)

**Look at these online examples of exploratory and explanatory visualizations.**

* [You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children's College Chances](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/28/upshot/you-draw-it-how-family-income-affects-childrens-college-chances.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all)  (if you hit hit the NYT paywall, Google "You Draw It: How Family Income Predicts Children’s College Chances" and click on the first result)
* [An Interactive Visualization of Every Line in Hamilton ](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/hamilton/)
* [Bussed out - How America moves its homeless](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study)

For each of these visualizations, tell us:

* Is it exploratory or explanatory, and why do you think so?
* What question(s) about the data did the authors try to answer?
* What new insights did you learn from the visualization?
* Who is the likely audience of the visualization?
* Does it have a point of view or a message, and can you describe it?


## 3. *Prepare for next Week* (2 points)

* Create a Class Activity Notebook

    * Create a Google Doc and add your name and email address at the top of it.
    * Make the document sharable for everyone with the link but not the public. That way, TFs can access it without having to request access.
    * Submit the URL of the Google Doc on Canvas as part of your homework (the assignment is in Module Week 1 - Homework - Class Activities).


* Install Tableau and a first Dataset

  * STEP 1. DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING A TABLEAU DESKTOP ACADEMIC LICENSE (REQUIRES AN .EDU EMAIL)

    If you have a .edu email address, download and install the free 1-year academic license for Tableau Desktop by completing the process [here](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students) (using your .edu email). If you have problems getting this to work, see here

  * STEP 2. REGISTER WITH TABLEAU PUBLIC (AND OPTION FOR A FREE, LIMITED, NON-ACADEMIC TABLEAU DESKTOP LICENSE)

    Tableau Public is a platform that allows you to share your visualizations with others (e.g., your professors, TFs, and colleagues). I encourage you to sign up for it [here](https://public.tableau.com/s/) and signing up for a Tableau Public account. Click “Sign In” in the upper right and create an account.

    Note: While registering for Tableau Public, you will be offered the chance to download a Tableau Public Desktop license. If you do not qualify for a Tableau Academic License, go ahead and download this version which offers sufficient capabilities to fully participate in this workshop (please let me know if you end up using this license type for class, some of the instruction would need to be modified). If you were able to download the full-featured license in Step 1, above, you do not want this version. You want to use the version you already have downloaded.

  * STEP 3. START LEARNING

    Once you have installed Tableau, watch the videos and follow along at: [http://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources](http://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources). That page also provides links to many datasets you can use to learn Tableau or for your final projects. You can also practice with the videos of the Tableau Starter Kit here to begin your journey. We will show you how to use Tableau in class as well.

    Note: Tableau offers free access to the Tableau E-Learning platform for one year to academic license holders. This is a fantastic resource; be on the lookout for an email from Tableau with credentials for this platform after you register!

    In addition to the videos and resources highlighted in the Tableau Starter Kit, Tableau offers free instructor-led interactive web seminars to take you to the next level. See here

  * STEP 4: Download the Dataset

    The Excel file “SuperDrugsPrescriptionsV2.xlsx”, linked [here](https://bit.ly/superdrugsprescriptionsV2) , contains fictitious pharmaceutical sales information. Download the file onto your laptop as an Excel .xlsx file. Make sure that you can load the data into Tableau. If you like, start visualizing the data in Tableau.



## Lab Reading & Quiz Reminder

Don't forget to complete the lab pre-reading and pre-quiz before each lab. Next Monday is a holiday, so we ask you to work on your lab alone. We will not have a class on Monday. Therefore, the pre-reading quiz will be open the entire week. Instructions for the lab will be posted on Canvas in the *Week 2* module.


## 4. Submit Homework on Canvas

You can use a Google doc to answer the HW questions. Include the screenshots of your visualizations (Q1) in the document. You can then create a PDF file from your Google doc by either using "File -> Download -> pdf "or "File -> Print "and selecting "Save as PDF "in the destination drop down.

**Name your PDF file appropriately (e.g., hw1) and include your name.** Add your name to the filename using CamelCase style, e.g., ```hw1_JohnDoe.pdf``` if your name is John Doe.

**Go to Canvas and click on the HW Part 1 - Submission link in the *Week 1* module and upload your PDF**

**Congratulations on finishing Homework 1! Remember that weekly HW will always be due on Monday.**
